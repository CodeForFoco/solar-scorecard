Solar Scorecard project: track Fort Collins renewable/solar energy goals.

## Background 
Create an up-to-date web-based data visualization tool for tracking solar contributions with respect to [City of Fort Collins 2015 Climate Action Plan](http://www.fcgov.com/environmentalservices/pdf/cap-framework-2015.pdf), whose goal is to:
> reduce emissions 20% below 2005 levels by 2020, 80% below 2005 levels by 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. 

### Detailed Project Requirements
1. Create interactive, web-based, graphical depiction (chart) for each of the three emissions benchmarks mentioned above.
1. Incorporate solar power's contribution toward these goals by using publicly available Photovoltaic (PV) permit data, specifically permits which have been issued to applicants requesting construction of PV facilities. Each permit contains basic PV data regarding size and quantity, which may be used as a rough estimate of how much solar energy the solar structure will provide. See [comment](https://github.com/CodeForFoco/solar-scorecard/issues/1#issuecomment-300964480) for details on viewing this data. 
1. Make the tool as portable as possible so that it may be used for similar projects in other communities.
