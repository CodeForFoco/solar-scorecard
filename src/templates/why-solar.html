    <p class="md-title">On Solar Scorecard, we've chosen to measure only additional solar production in the city,
      rather than generically tracking all carbon-emission sources. This choice was made for many reasons, some of
      which have to do with data availability. This page serves to explains why that choice was made and what things
      this methodology doesn't precisely capture about overall impact of the city's chosen Climate Goals.

    <h2>Carbon Production Ratios in Fort Collins</h2>

    <solar-scorecard-ratios></solar-scorecard-ratios>

    <p>The above chart describes the carbon-dioxide-equivilent emissions related to categories of use in Fort Collins,
      as described in the <a href="https://www.fcgov.com/climateaction/pdf/2015-community-carbon-inventory.pdf?1494967837">
        2015 City of Fort Collins Carbon Inventory</a>. We are most interested in tackling electricity, which makes up
      50% of the carbon emission in the City of Fort Collins.</p>

    <p>Emissions from electricity use are caused by fossil fuel combustion. Most of the electricity for Fort Collins is
      generated by coal and hydropower. Samll amounts come from natural gas, and increasing amounts of renewable wind
      and solar resources. These resources are produced locally in City of Fort Collins and by the Platte River Power
      Authority municipal cooperative. Fort Collins, Loveland, Longmont, and Estes Park all share membership in the
      PRPA.</p>

    <h2>So, why count only solar?</h2>

    <p>Solar is a locally abundant resource. We believe it is the primary method of directly impacting local
      carbon-production in electricity. While wind and geothermal can both be done within city limits, neither has
      nearly the ubiquity of solar, nor do they have the ease of installation.</p>

    <p>It also just so happens that we have access, via building permits in a public Fort Collins City API, access to
      new solar installations in the city of Fort Collins. No such records exist for wind.</p>

    <h2>What about wind?</h2>

    <p>It blows!</p>

    <p>More seriously, although wind energy is a great renewable source, it is currently ineffective within city
      limits. This is due to its construction limitations and the amount of consistent and reliable wind. Platte River
      Power Authority is in the process of purchasing more wind energy, which will help its four member cities (Fort
      Collins, Loveland, Longmont, and Estes Park) reduce its overall emissions.</p>

    <h2>What about geothermal?</h2>

    <p>Geothermal is an effective renewable resource to reduce emissions by using the earth's ground temperatures for
      heating and cooling. The amount of geothermal installations within City of Fort Collins is minimal and difficult
      to track. We expect that the the amount of kW offset by that production is negligible.</p>

    <h2>What about increasing energy efficiency?</h2>

    <p>Steps to increase energy efficiency such as new insulation, LED lighting, sealing leaks, efficient home
      appliances, and more are all very good for the city and world. Increasing efficiency is typically the most cost
      effective way to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

    <p> That said, we chose not to include that in the analysis for one simple reason: analyzing all the buildings that
      are conducting these measures and the impact that each project has is too difficult. This project is built by
      volunteers, and even a whole fleet of city employees would be unlikely to be able to accurately measure progress
      in that way.</p>
