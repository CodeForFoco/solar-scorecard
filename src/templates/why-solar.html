    <h1>Why Count Solar?</h1>

    <p>On Solar Scorecard, we've chosen to measure only additional solar production in the city,
        rather than generically tracking all carbon-emission sources. This page serves to explains why that choice
        was made and what things this methodology doesn't capture about overall impact of the city's chosen Climate Goals.

    <h2>Carbon Production Ratios in Fort Collins</h2>

    <solar-scorecard-ratios></solar-scorecard-ratios>

    <p>The above chart describes the carbon-dioxide-equivilent emissions related to categories of use in Fort Collins,
        as described in the <a href="https://www.fcgov.com/climateaction/pdf/2015-community-carbon-inventory.pdf?1494967837">
            2015 City of Fort Collins Carbon Inventory</a>.
        We are most interested in tackling electricity,
        which makes up 50% of the carbon emission in the City of Fort Collins.</p>

    <p>Emissions from electricity use are caused by fossil fuel combustion.
        Most of our electricity is generated by coal and hydropower, with a small amount from natural gas,
        and increasing amounts of renewable wind and solar resources. These resources are produced locally
        in City of Fort Collins and by the Platte River Power Authority municipal cooperative.
        Fort Collins, Loveland, Longmont, and Estes Park all share this resource.</p>

    <h2>So, why count only solar?</h2>

    <p>Solar is a locally abundant resource.
        We believe it is the primary method of directly impact local carbon-production in electricity.
        While wind and geothermal can both be done within city limits, neither has nearly the ubiquity of solar,
        nor do they have the ease of installation.
    </p>

    <p>It also just so happens that we have access, via building permits in a public API,
        access to new solar installations in the city of Fort Collins. No such records exist for wind.
    </p>

    <h2>What about wind?</h2>

    <p>It blows!</p>

    <p>More seriously, although wind energy is a great renewable source, it is currently ineffective within city limits.
        This is due to its construction limitations and the amount of consistent and reliable wind.
        Platte River Power Authority is in the process of purchasing more wind energy, which will help
        its four member cities (Fort Collins, Loveland, Longmont, and Estes Park) reduce its overall emissions.</p>

    <h2>What about geothermal?</h2>

    <p>Geothermal is an effective renewable resource to reduce emissions by using the earth's ground temperatures
        for heating and cooling.
        The amount of geothermal installations within City of Fort Collins is minimal and difficult to track.
        We expect that the the amount of kW offset by that production is negligible.
    </p>

    <h2>What about increasing energy efficiency?</h2>
    <p>
        Energy efficiency measures such as new insulation, LED lighting, sealing leaks, efficient home appliances, and more.
        It is typically the most cost effective way to reduce current carbon emissions.
        Analyzing all the buildings that are conducting these measures and the impact that each project has
        is too difficult to maintain accuracy.
