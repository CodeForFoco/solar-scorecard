<h1>About Solar Scorecard</h1>

<h2>Goal of Project</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to create an up-to-date web-based data visualization tool for tracking solar contributions with respect to <a href="http://www.fcgov.com/environmentalservices/pdf/cap-framework-2015.pdf">City of Fort Collins 2015 Climate Action Plan</a>, whose goal is to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>reduce emissions 20% below 2005 levels by 2020, 80% below 2005 levels by 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>Since the Climate Action Plan goal is in terms of aggregate 2005 greenhouse gases (ghg), for our purposes we will focus only on the emissions due to electrical.  Based on <a href="https://www.fcgov.com/climateaction/pdf/2015-community-carbon-inventory.pdf?1494967837">Fort Collins 2015 Community Carbon Inventory</a>, we will assume that 50% of emissions are due to electrical activity.</p>
<h3>Define CO2 Reference Points</h3>
<p>In 2005, ghg emissions due to CO2 was 2.3 Million Metric Tons (mmt).  Therefore, we will assume the electrical-only emissions in 2005 were <strong>1,150,000 mt</strong>. Therefore, the 2020 electrical-only goal is <strong>920,000 mt (230,000 mt reduction)</strong>, and the 2030 electrical-only goal is <strong>230,000 mt (920,000 mt reduction)</strong>.</p>
<h3>Convert Solar Capacity to CO2 Reduction</h3>
<p>Based on the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references">EPA's Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator</a>, we will assume that every kilowatt hour (kWh) of solar energy produced will reduce emissions by <strong>.000703 mt</strong>.</p>
<p>Using these numbers we can express the 2020, 2030, and 2050 goals in terms of the kilowatt reductions needed to meet each goal.</p>
<pre><code>2020: 20% Reduction
230,000 mt / (.000703 mt / 1 kWh * 8760 hr) =  37,348 kW

2030: 80% Reduction
920,000 mt / (.000703 mt / 1 kWh * 8760 hr) = 149,392 kW

2050: 100% Reduction (carbon neutrality)
1,150,000 mt / (.000703 mt / 1 kWh * 8760 hr) = 186,740 kW
</code></pre>
<p>Using the <a href="http://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php">PVWatts Calculator</a> we can calculate Fort Collins' photovoltaic system output in kWh per year.  Assuming the variables in the table below, Fort Collins' system output is <strong>6,111 kWh/year</strong>.  Since there are 8760 hours in a year, Fort Collins' power output is <strong>0.6976 kW</strong>.</p>
